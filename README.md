## FAQ

### How does it work?

Discord Bot Builder uses a modular system, where each module contains a set of commands that can be added to your bot. By using this modular system, you can easily create and manage various functionalities for your Discord bot. For an up-to-date list of available modules or to update existing modules, please refer to the [Bot-scripts repo](https://github.com/Allybe/DBB-BotScripts).

### Can I add my own custom commands?

At the current moment, no. But it's a planned feature for the future!
