# FAQ

## How does it work?

Discord Bot Builder makes bots based on modules, each module has commands that you can add to the bot. If you want to see the current list of modules or update modules, see the [Bot-scripts repo](https://github.com/Allybe/DBB-BotScripts).

## Can I add my own custom commands?

At the current moment, no. But it's a planned feature for the future!
